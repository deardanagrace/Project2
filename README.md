## Vacayyy
#### Dana Capistrano

### Overview
"Vacayyy" is a satirical p5.play game critiquing toxic mass tourism and mission trips. These trips to these islands are often coming from a selfish motive. Whether to help colonize these islands "for the better" or escape from ordinary life, mass tourism harms more than good. The user plays as a young, innocent girl coming to the island to help improve it and to also vacation at the same time. Follow her along as she visits the island and talks to locals. Interact with them and the culture and help out where you see fit.


### Technical Details

This program uses the p5.play game library and the utilization of state machines, conditional logic, classes, animation, collision detection, and micro-interactions, to create its immersive maze experience.
